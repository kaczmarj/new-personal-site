## About Me

I am a current Ph.D students at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York working on Computational Biology in the [Koo Lab](https://koolab.cshl.edu/). My research aims at using Deep Learning techniques to interpret complex genomic regulation mechnisims. My current thesis work focus on identifying cis-regulatory elements that drive post-transcriptional regulatory functions with deep nueral networks.

This website contains brief descriptions of the projects I've been working on and my [resume](/assets/files/CV_2024.pdf). 

This website is under construction. More updates coming.
