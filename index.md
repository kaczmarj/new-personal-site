I am an MD-PhD student at Stony Brook University in New York.
My current work is on improving predictions of patient outcomes using digital pathology
and other data modalities.

## Interests

- Deep learning / computer vision
- Medical imaging (digital pathology, radiology)
- Interpretable deep learning

This website is a work in progress.

Please do see [my blog](/blog/). I try to write about interesting and useful topics,
particularly things I've done over the course of my PhD.
